The Jenkins plugin of Asqatasun is dedicated to integrate the web accessibility 
tests Asqatasun can do into a Quality Assurance (QA) plateform, here **Jenkins**.
It allows for example to add accessibility tests of a web application on a nightly 
build process (for instance just after the unit tests and functional tests).
